I can't read, so it's a good idea to have a audiobook generator.
The generator will allow me to listen to any pdf documents, that
I provide as an input and also convert them to mp3 file to make
it shareable. 

A video by the programming hero, inspired me for this build, that
will make my life less complicated. Thank you !!
Here's the video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZ_5cvrXJI&t=661s

I plan to also add more features:
1. A media player, where I can play, pause, stop listening the book
2. Page skip or re-read options
3. Options to skip the foreword and Introduction
4. Adjust the read speed of the speaker
5. A read along GUI
